# Unifin
For our HackSheffield6 Project we've decided to create a finanice based mobile app with intergration with Googe Cloud's services.

# Features
## Reciept Interpreter
  Enables users to upload or take a photography of an reciept/invoice and have it automatically inputed as an spending entry in the account overview. This is made possible with Gogle's Vision ML kit to detect text from a given document.
## CapitalOne Accunt data retrieval
  Using the demo API from CaptialOne, the app is able to retrieve transaction details from the account, as well as its metadata such as spending catagories, etc. This is to be interpreted in list and graph form together with reciept interpreter, provides a comprehensive overview of both cash and cashless spendings.
### Conculsion
As the first project we have done at a hackathon, althought we've had ambious plans for it in the beginning, it turned out to be a respectable product.
